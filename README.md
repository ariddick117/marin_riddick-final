# This is an In-Class Example of What Trevor Wants README Files to Look Like

This is where you put a small description of what the project is.

## Description

Explain brand history and a description of the project, very similar to above

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10, CSS3, HTML5
* Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc. (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference)
* Also using lastest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM Script)

### Installing

* cd to the directory of your choice and hack away!
