# Thames River Anglers Association 
## Website Redesign

By taking the existing website and its content, we have created a different take on anglers.org for the Thames River Anglers Association.

## Description

We have created six fully designed wireframes as well as three coded pages (Home, About, and Contact) for the TRAA. Our concept for the design was based around condensing all of the information on their current site into optional flyout menus and smaller areas to allow for a more seamless scrolling experience. Users can now find exactly what they want faster and can choose what sections they want to learn more about. 

Since the midterm, we have added responsive design and made any layout changes that were discussed at that time.
