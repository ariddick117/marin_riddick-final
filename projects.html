					This is what sets the TRAA apart from other clubs and organizations. You'll find us right in the water clearing obstructions from streams, measuring returning salmonids & taking scale samples for DNA analysis, education through trout hatchery tours & stream walks, being a voice for the Thames River watershed & its inhabitants and the list goes on.

					This year's TRAA Paddle & Fish took place on July 13th and we had around a dozen participants from the TRAA, the Forest City Flyfishers and the Western Ontario Fish & Game Protective Association.<br>
					<br>It was a beautiful day with the thunderstorms holding off for our after-paddle BBQ. This year's route took us from Elgin Road 73, through the town of Dorchester to the Lion's Park just west of town.<br>
					<br>Most, if not all of us, had never been on this stretch of the South Thames River. Our efforts were rewarded with some of the prettiest scenery that any river has to offer.

					Many dogs and burgers were consumed. <br>
					<br>Special thanks to Mary (centre) who got up early in the morning just to shuttle everyone back and forth between the launch site and this park.<br>
					<br>Also, many thanks to the Dorchester Lion's Club for providing this perfect venue for a BBQ at the end of the Paddle & Fish route.

					We have had a very successful hatch of rainbow trout this year with minimal die-off. However, it was time to say goodbye and turn them loose into their new homes. The donor stream was Dingman Creek.<br>
					<br>Everything went smoothly and the weather was glorious. It was also great to have a member of the London Environmental Network come out to lend a hand and learn a little bit about what the TRAA is all about.<br>

			</a>
			<p>
				The brown trout were transferred from the TRAA hatchery and released at the same site on Medway Creek as in previous years.  TRAA members loaded up the trout fry into the transfer tank at the hatchery site. We then proceeded to the release site north of London, Ontario.<br>
				<br>We were met there by two of the landowners through which this section of Medway Creek flows. They also brought out a large contingent of family and friends to lend a helping hand.<br>
				<br>This video above gives you a pretty good idea how it went. It was a beautiful day, the stream was in perfect shape and everyone was smiling and laughing. Good times.
